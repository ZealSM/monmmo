/**
 * The numbers in the pinned copy, read out of the repo instead of typed in.
 *
 *   node facts.js              print what it found, write nothing
 *   node facts.js --write      write .facts.json
 *   node facts.js --check      exit 1 if a fact is missing or two sources disagree
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Prose in content.js is written by hand and should be. Numbers are not: the
 * test count, how far the walk gets, how much of the script reads — those move
 * every few days, and every time they moved somebody had to remember to edit
 * four channels. They did not always remember. #welcome carried a test count
 * that was eleven hundred short for weeks.
 *
 * So the figures live here, are read from the repo's own notes, and go into the
 * copy as {{PLACEHOLDERS}}.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND
 *
 * A number nothing computes cannot come back wrong, which is worse than a number
 * that is stale. So:
 *
 *   - every fact names the file and the line it was read from;
 *   - a fact that cannot be found is an ERROR, never a silent blank or a
 *     remembered default;
 *   - the test count is read from TWO places and they have to agree.
 *
 * That last one is not paranoia. This project lost two sessions to a status
 * block that was copied forward thirty-nine times without anybody re-running a
 * line of it, and the wrong number in it had been corrected — in a document
 * nobody reads first.
 *
 * SOURCES
 *
 *   claude/next-session-prompt.md   "Where the reading stands" and the floor
 *                                   table, both of which the project re-runs
 *                                   and rewrites wholesale rather than patching
 *   claude/milestone-<n>-*.md       the newest one, for its closing test count
